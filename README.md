## Hi there!

# Short introduction
I'm Kristian from Bulgaria, and I enjoy Development! I like to work on software that will help a company grow. I am keen on Robotics and Engineering as well. In my free time I like to watch videos and podcasts about Cybersecurity, which is another field I would like to improve in and work in one day. The programming languages I have worked with are Python, C# and PHP. I would like to learn new technologies and improve!
